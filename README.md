Project Details

This goal of this project is to create a product tracking system that can track products by serial number along the supply chain all the way to the customer's hands. For this project, the client is Apple and I assume to role of a database architect. An apple product is created by the manufacturer. It is then shipped down the supply chain all the way to the store where it is then sold to a customer. The supply chain looks like this:

Manufacturer -> Warehouse -> Distributor -> Sub-distributor -> Channel Partner -> Zone -> Store
